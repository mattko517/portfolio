#  The unseen threat of IUU Fishing in South America
##  Outline

I want to highlight the documented and undocumented effects of China's distant water fishing fleet around South America.

Project Structure
- Illustrate the historical trends in catch for fisheries in South American waters
- Show how the Chinese distant water fleet (DWF) has grown in size and influence over the years
- Speculate the current unreported catch of the DWF using reports from South America
- Forecast state of fisheries if we continue as is
