#  The unseen threat of IUU Fishing in South America
##  Outline

I want to highlight the documented and undocumented effects of China's distant water fishing fleet around South America.

Project Structure
- Illustrate the historical trends in catch for fisheries in South American waters
- Show how the Chinese distant water fleet (DWF) has grown in size and influence over the years
- Speculate the current unreported catch of the DWF using reports from South America
- Forecast state of fisheries if we continue as is

# The data

My working group sketched an infographic that sheds some light on IUU Fishing in South America. Our goal was to provide the reader with a basic foundation so that they could make educated decisions on the issue. This is one of the rough drafts that we came up with.

We didn't put any data on the graphic partly because we thought it might be too distracting to the reader. My hope is that this project becomes a necessary supplement to a graphic like the one above by providing more data analysis. For my project I am utilizing two data sources:

***1. FAO FishStat***

The FAO provides catch data on commercial species for all the world's oceans through Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. Members of the UN send their catch statistics that are then compiled in FAO's FishStat. One of my initial sketches uses this data to show the increase in total catch of Humbold squid - a heavily fished species in South American waters.

I hope to use this data to illustrate both the historical trend of commercially important species in South American Waters and the potential state of fisheries in the near future.

***2. Global Fishing Watch***
GFW is another organization that provides data on fishing activity throughout the world. Global Fishing Watch focuses more on increasing transparency and providing information that is not readily available. I plan to use their data set on transhipment behavior to show how the Chinese DWF can operate year round without leaving the area which is exacerbating the situation. I also want to use their datasets on fishing vessels to speculate how large the DWF's unreported catch is.
