# User Research Protocol
## Goals
- Is the user convinced with the severity of the issue?
- What is confusing, if anything?
- Clean up aesthetic

## Target Audience
- Professionals trying to familiarize themselves with the fishing industry in South America

Due to the specific nature of my final project I choose individuals from my working group to interview. 

## Interview Script
Brief introduction of my project and my agenda for the project.
Brief discussion of user research/interview
- My goal for this interview is to get feedback on my presentation. I'm talking to you to see what is effective and what isn't and if there are parts that confuse you.

Star spots of confusion/where more clarification is necessary

- What data visualizations are essential to the story? How can they be refined?
- What data visualizations are not effective? What about them makes them ineffective?
- Can you see a thread running through the entire story connecting everything?
- What other questions/comments do you have?

## Findings
All three of my interviewees were part of my working group. Two of them were graduate students and one was a State Departement employee. For the most part, my data visualizations were met with good reception. There were a few comments though particularly concerning my graph on China's total catch by region (Figure 3). Two of the three participants argued that my focus should be on the rise in the Southeast Pacific and Atlantic Southwest's totals rather than the region next to China. As R put it, "Highlighting the low activity in the Western Central Pacific takes away from the point you just made before Figure 3."

Another issue was raised about my data visualization concerning the number of active vessels in the South Pacific (Figure 2). In 2017, Peru had an abnormally large number of ships active. This was incongruent with the rest of my narrative and made my story harder to believe. I agree with them and I have emailed the data manager at the SPRFMO to see what is going on with that number. Our speculation is that it was a typo or a change in policy after the SDGs were implemented. We can see corresponding changes in the other figures in 2016 as well.

One of the graduate students in my group mentioned that it would be helpful to include a definition of biologically sustainable/unsustainable levels of fishing. They understood that South American waters were doing poor relative to the rest of the world's fishing regions but didn't understand the severity of the issue based on my visualization.

## Final Thoughts
I found this user research to be very informative and I plan on taking all the recommendations I was given and applying them to my project. I've included a link to my shorthand story for reference.
