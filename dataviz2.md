*Tracking government debt seperately across time can help give a better economic snapshot compared to the first chart.*


## Here's another visualization for the same data

*This data visualization lets us explore individual countries even deeper than the last visualization.*

These three unique visualizations are a great example of how different techniques can be used with one dataset to illustrate multiple narratives. I chose to display the third data visualization as such to magnify the scope of government debt while continuing to display it over a period of time. Whereas the first and second visualization might be used in a policy brief or report, the third visualization could be used in a news article or more informal form of writing because of its layout and interactive features. A similar data visualization I've seen is one of COVID cases based on state over time. Charts like these allow the user to engage with the data when placed in news articles or blog posts.
