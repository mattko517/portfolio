# What do the world's fish stock levels really tell us?
## The UN and its SDGs
> Target 14.4
By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.


Here's a chart pulled from the FAO's website on target 14.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals.

As you can see, it's a bit difficult to gather a lot of information from the visualization. I chose this graphic because it provides valuable information but lacks the clarity needed to properly interpret the information. I set out to make some adjustments to this chart to see if I could create a better data visualization with the same dataset.

I started by wireframing a solution to my original data visualization critique. My main goals were to create a chart with more gravitas and to declutter/create a better aesthetic for the data. My first few sketches were line graphs that showed each region’s proportion of fish stocks that is at sustainable levels. Here’s one of the sketches I came up with.

Although I knew this was far from the finished product, I wanted to know what other people thought before proceeding so I shared these sketches with some peers to get their opinions and to see what I could improve on. I told them my goals for this data visualization, and I also showed them the original one from the FAO. Most of the feedback I received revolved around clarity and confusion on what they were looking at. It was difficult to decipher my initial sketches and I wasn't able to show how the different regions were changing over time because of all the stuff going on in my visualization. Taking this feedback into consideration, I went back to the drawing board. I wanted to keep the line graphs because I thought that they were the easiest to read and to demonstrate the change over time but I agreed that my initial sketches were just as meaningless as the FAO's because of the confusion it caused. My final design led to this

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5360049"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


I decided to keep the line graphs but separate them by region.
