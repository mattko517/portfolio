# What do the world's fish stock levels really tell us?
## The UN and its SDGs
Here's a chart pulled from the FAO's website on target 14.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals. It shows the health of the world's oceans from 2015 to 2017.

As you can see, it's a bit difficult to gather a lot of information from the visualization. I set out to make some adjustments to this chart to see if I could create a better data visualization with the same dataset.

I started by wireframing a solution to my original data visualization critique. My main goals were to create a chart with more gravitas and to declutter/create a better aesthetic for the data. My first few sketches were line graphs that showed each region’s proportion of fish stocks that is at sustainable levels. Here’s one of the sketches I came up with.
