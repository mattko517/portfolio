# Part 3
## Changes Made
1. After my user research I made some changes that were suggested. The first thing I did was reorder my story and data visualizations to make a more compelling story.
Instead of beginning with the current state of South American waters, I started with the historical trends in vessels and catch to frame unsustainabile level of fishing going on in South America.
2. My second change was in the line graph showing China's total catch by region. To increase clarity I changed the South American regions to blue and the Chinese region to red.
3. My last change was to the ending of my project. I failed to provide a concrete next step/recommendation in my previous draft and the ending was a bit inconclusive. I added 
three recommendations and illustrated the costs of IUU fishing in a more effective manner.

## Reflections
Some of the changes I made to the final draft were because of my change in audience. 
I tried to get rid of technical jargon and complex concepts to keep my classmates engaged and help them understand the issue. My final audience
also changed the layout of the presentation. If I were presenting to my working group, I would have gotten rid of most of the pictures and extra verbiage to focus on the data visualizations.
Instead, I added graphics and smooth transitions to keep my audience engaged.

My biggest takeaway from this entire process was the importance of creating a thread through my different data visualizations to tell a story.
