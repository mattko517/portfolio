This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Matt and I use he/him pronouns. I'm currently in the MSPPM-DC track program at CMU's Heinz College and I plan on graduating in the Spring of 2022. I hope I can effectively persuade my audience through the use of graphics and dataviz by the end of this mini and use the skills I learn in a career with the federal government working on environmental policy/natural resource management.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to tailor my data and graphics to specific audiences to elicit specific responses. I would like to use my data analysis skills more effectively through the skills I learn in this class.

# Portfolio
Here are some examples of my data visualizations!
